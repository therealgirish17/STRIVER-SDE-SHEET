<h1>Why considering first row or first column separately?</h1>

<p>Because if the first row has zero, then the first row and the corresponding column has to be set to 0<br/>
  But now if you consider some random element is 0, then the first row will be set to 0, due to that random element.<br/>
  It indicates that the particular column has to be made to 0 and not the first row. In order to remove this<br/>
  discrepancy, first row is treated specially. Same reasoning could be applied if the first column was priveleged<br/>
  rather than the first row.
